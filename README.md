## Intro
 I've been working on a myriad of [Software Defined Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio) experiments for a while now. The aim of this repo is to serve as an archive of some of that research and experimentation.

I am including easy-to-read Jupyter Notebooks with some documentation to hopefully make these projects more accessible.
